Walkthrough - A series of messages before the user enters the site that will allow them to understand the function of the application before they enter. Mobile Accessibility - Adapt the application for mobile users, provide a swiping interface. Styling - Provide a Fun and Artsy Background and Styling Location Based Services - Only flyers posted within the proximity of the user will be accessible to view.
